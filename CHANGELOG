RELEASE v0.05 - radi.py remake that is capable of using freeradius dictionary
    CHANGES:
    - introduced dictionary functionality. The tool is capable of reading
      the free radius dictionaries and use the data to determine
      the correct type/value for the given AVP name.
    - most of the functionality was moved to a libradi library, so that
      it will be easy to use the functionality in other projects
    - all types but tlv are implemented
    - now the path to the dictionary files can be specified as a CLI
      parameter and the default path can be specified in the config (radi.py)
 
    TODO:
    - Implement the missing types (eg. tlv)
    - Add unit tests for EVERYTHING
    - polish & refactor
